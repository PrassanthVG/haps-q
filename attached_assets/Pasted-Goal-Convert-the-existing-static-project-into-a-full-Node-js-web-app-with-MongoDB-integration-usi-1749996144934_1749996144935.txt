Goal:
Convert the existing static project into a full Node.js web app with MongoDB integration, using the old design but replacing all page content with updated content provided in haps final content.txt.
Use the existing HTML design from aviation-quiz (1).html as the template base.

Do not change any styling, button layout, or theme ‚Äî preserve the original look and feel.

However, DO NOT use any of the old content.

Instead, completely replace the content with the updated content from haps final content.txt across all 3 pages.

This includes replacing all text, form fields, headings, labels, etc., exactly as specified.

Do not modify or add new words ‚Äî only use what is provided in haps final content.txt.

üß† Backend Functionality (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
Create a Node.js server using Express.

Connect the backend to MongoDB Atlas with this URI in your .env file:


MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://aviationhaps:vA2DRgOxesIZ8foK@haps.37enzmt.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=HAPS
Use this database:


Database Name: leads
Schema for registrations:


{
  _id: "ObjectId",
  fullName: "string",
  phoneNumber: "string",
  email: "string",
  cityOfResidence: "string",
  education: "string",
  quizCompleted: "boolean",
  registeredAt: "ISODate",
  completedAt: "ISODate",
  percentage: "number",
  quizmark: "number"
}
üîí Security Best Practices
Use dotenv to manage secrets.

Sanitize user inputs using express-validator or similar.

Add basic security middleware:

helmet

cors with proper origin rules

rate-limit if needed

Avoid direct exposure of sensitive information.

Implement server-side validation for all form inputs.

üåê Compatibility & Design
Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile.

Add the logo LYFT logo-01.png to the top-left corner.

Apply the color scheme from:
WhatsApp Image 2025-06-10 at 19.57.19_7c84f8ce
to match the branding.

Do not change any words or context from the provided content.
